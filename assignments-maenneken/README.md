# Motion Planning - Programming Assignments

Repository with tasks and example cases for the motion planning class.

## Getting Started

* We will fork this repository for you and provide you with access
* Add this repository as a remote, so you can stay updated

```
git remote add upstream git@git.tu-berlin.de:imrc/teaching/motion-planning/2025_ss/assignments.git
```

* Keep an eye on the automated tests on gitlab, which tell you at the very least if your program structure matches our expectation. Grading will be done on more complicated test cases.
  
## Update Your Fork

If we add new assignments or example files, you have to update your fork with our latest changes. For that you can use the following.

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Submission

Before the given deadline, add the correct tag (this exact spelling!) to your code and push it

```
git tag assignment4 main
git push origin assignment4
```

(In case you need to change the tag, use the `-f` flag for both `git tag` and `git push`.)

Code that is not tagged will receive 0 points.
